## Abstract

Bringing real world permissioned assets (e.g. tokenized treasury yield products) on-chain require certain levels of control over asset actions/properties such as transfers, holders (whitelists), and more.

The `permissions` module allows managing certain prefixed actions and roles for real world assets and permissioned denoms created within a namespace on the chain-level. It provides a flexible and extensible way to define and enforce permissions and roles and serves as the entry point through which real world assets can be natively issued and managed on Injective.
