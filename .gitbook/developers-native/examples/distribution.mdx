The `distribution` module is extended from the cosmos sdk [distribution module](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/x/distribution), where delegator can withdraw their staking rewards from the validator.

Distribution -> MsgWithdrawValidatorCommission

## MsgWithdrawDelegatorReward

This message is used to withdraw all available delegator staking rewards from the validator.

```ts
import {  Network } from "@injectivelabs/networks";
import { MsgBroadcasterWithPk } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/core/tx";
import { MsgWithdrawDelegatorReward } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/core/modules";

const injectiveAddress = "inj1...";
const validatorAddress = "inj1...";

/* create message in proto format */
const msg = MsgWithdrawDelegatorReward.fromJSON({
  validatorAddress,
  delegatorAddress: injectiveAddress,
});

const privateKey = "0x...";

/* broadcast transaction */
const txHash = await new MsgBroadcasterWithPk({
  privateKey,
  network: Network.Mainnet
}).broadcast({
  msgs: msg
});

console.log(txHash);
```

## MsgWithdrawValidatorCommission

This message is used by the validator to withdraw the commission earned.

```ts
import { Network } from "@injectivelabs/networks";
import { MsgBroadcasterWithPk } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/core/tx";
import { MsgWithdrawValidatorCommission } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/core/modules";

const injectiveAddress = "inj1...";
const validatorAddress = "inj1...";

/* create message in proto format */
const msg = MsgWithdrawValidatorCommission.fromJSON({
  validatorAddress,
});

const privateKey = "0x...";

/* broadcast transaction */
const txHash = await new MsgBroadcasterWithPk({
  privateKey,
  network: Network.Testnet
}).broadcast({
  msgs: msg
});

console.log(txHash);
```
