## What are Modules?​

Modules are foundational components in Injective’s blockchain architecture, each built to provide specific functionalities. A module is essentially a self-contained unit with well-defined logic and services, allowing Injective to efficiently manage diverse operations across the network.

Modules work like building blocks that can be combined to expand the blockchain’s capabilities. This approach reduces the friction and technical complexity of implementing core features, making development easier. Each module operates independently but communicates with others through inter-module messaging, making Injective’s architecture modular and adaptable. This allows Injective to continuously evolve, delivering targeted upgrades and functionality without overhauling the entire system.
