title: Injective Name Service
---

Within this section, we will look at how to query the Injective name service contracts.

## Abstraction Service (deprecated)

~~You can use our `InjNameService` abstraction to query the smart contracts with a single method call. Below this example, you can also find the raw implementation on how to query the smart contracts in case you need more flexibility.~~

```ts lines highlight={5}
import { InjNameService } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ui-ts";
import { getNetworkEndpoints, Network } from "@injectivelabs/networks";

const injNameService = new InjNameService(Network.Testnet);
const name = "ninja.inj";

// Fetch the address for the particular name
const addressForName = await injNameService.fetchInjAddress(name);

// Fetch the name for the particular address
const nameFromAddress = await injNameService.fetchInjName(addressForName);
```

## Raw Smart Contract Querying

Example code snippets to resolve .inj domain name.

## Domain Resolution

- Get resolver address

```ts lines
import {
  Network,
  getNetworkEndpoints,
  getInjNameRegistryContractForNetwork,
} from "@injectivelabs/networks";
import { nameToNode, normalizeName } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/utils";
import {
  ChainGrpcWasmApi,
  QueryResolverAddress,
  InjNameServiceQueryTransformer,
} from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/client/wasm";

const endpoints = getNetworkEndpoints(Network.Testnet);
const chainGrpcWasmApi = new ChainGrpcWasmApi(endpoints.grpc);

const registryContractAddress = getInjNameRegistryContractForNetwork(
  Network.Testnet
);

const node = "";

const query = new QueryResolverAddress({ node }).toPayload();

const response = await chainGrpcWasmApi.fetchSmartContractState(
  registryContractAddress,
  query
);

const resolverAddress =
  InjNameServiceQueryTransformer.resolverAddressResponseToResolverAddress(
    response
  );

console.log(resolverAddress);
```

- Get address for .inj domain name.

```ts lines
import {
  Network,
  getNetworkEndpoints,
  getInjNameReverseResolverContractForNetwork,
} from "@injectivelabs/networks";
import { nameToNode, normalizeName } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/utils";
import {
  ChainGrpcWasmApi,
  QueryInjectiveAddress,
  InjNameServiceQueryTransformer,
} from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/client/wasm";
import { nameToNode, normalizeName } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/client/wasm";
import { nameToNode, normalizeName } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/utils";

const endpoints = getNetworkEndpoints(Network.Testnet);
const chainGrpcWasmApi = new ChainGrpcWasmApi(endpoints.grpc);

const reverseResolverContractAddress =
  getInjNameReverseResolverContractForNetwork(Network.Testnet);

const name = "allen.inj";

const normalizedName = normalizeName(name);
const node = nameToNode(normalizedName);

const query = new QueryInjectiveAddress({ node }).toPayload();

const response = await chainGrpcWasmApi.fetchSmartContractState(
  reverseResolverContractAddress,
  query
);

const injectiveAddress =
  InjNameServiceQueryTransformer.injectiveAddressResponseToInjectiveAddress(
    response
  );

if (!injectiveAddress) {
  throw new Error(`address not found for ${name}`);
}

console.log(injectiveAddress);
```

## Reverse Resolution

- Get the primary name for injective address.

```ts lines
import {
  QueryInjName,
  ChainGrpcWasmApi,

  InjNameServiceQueryTransformer
} from '@injectivelabs/sdk-ts'
  import {
  Network,
  getNetworkEndpoints,
  getInjNameReverseResolverContractForNetwork
} from '@injectivelabs/networks'

const endpoints = getNetworkEndpoints(Network.Testnet)
const chainGrpcWasmApi = new ChainGrpcWasmApi(endpoints.grpc)

const reverseResolverContractAddress =
  getInjNameReverseResolverContractForNetwork(Network.Testnet)
const injectiveAddress = ''

const query = new QueryInjName({ address: injectiveAddress }).toPayload()

const response = await chainGrpcWasmApi.fetchSmartContractState(
  reverseResolverContractAddress,
  query,
)

const name = InjNameServiceQueryTransformer.injectiveNameResponseToInjectiveName(response)

if (!name) {
  throw new Error(`.inj not found for ${injectiveAddress}`)
}

const addressForName = /** fetch as above example */

if (addressForName.toLowerCase() !== address.toLowerCase()) {
  throw new Error(`.inj not found for ${injectiveAddress}`)
}

console.log(name)
```
