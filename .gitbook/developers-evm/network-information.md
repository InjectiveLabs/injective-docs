# EVM Network Information

## Injective EVM Mainnet Details

* Chain ID: `1776`
* JSON-RPC Endpoint: `https://sentry.evm-rpc.injective.network/`
* WS Endpoint: `wss://sentry.evm-ws.injective.network`
* Faucet: N/A, to obtain Mainnet INJ see [`injective.com/getinj`](https://injective.com/getinj/)
* Explorer: [`blockscout.injective.network`](https://blockscout.injective.network/)
* Explorer API: `https://blockscout-api.injective.network/api`

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the Injective Chain ID is natively `injective-1`. However, EVM uses a numeric chain ID of `1776`. While these are different, they map to the **same** network.

See [network information](../developers/network-information.md) for more details.
{% endhint %}

### More Providers

* Explorer - Blockscout mirror: [`injective.cloud.blockscout.com`](https://injective.cloud.blockscout.com)
* JSON-RPC - Quicknode [`quicknode.com/chains/inj`](https://www.quicknode.com/chains/inj)
  * Note that you will need to create an account on quicknode to obtain an endpoint URL
  * [Quicknode JSON-RPC documentation](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/injective/evm/eth_blockNumber)

### Permissioned

After the EVM Mainnet launch, there will be an initial permissioned period. During this period, developers will need to whitelist address(es). To do so, join the [Injective discord](https://discord.com/invite/NK4qdbv), then comment in [this discussion](https://discord.com/channels/739552603322450092/1189372652561895475/threads/1399997439041077379).

## Injective EVM Testnet Details

* Chain ID: `1439`
* JSON-RPC Endpoint: `https://k8s.testnet.json-rpc.injective.network/`
* WS Endpoint: `https://k8s.testnet.ws.injective.network/`
* Faucet: [`testnet.faucet.injective.network/`](https://testnet.faucet.injective.network/)
* Explorer: [`testnet.blockscout.injective.network/`](https://testnet.blockscout.injective.network/)
* Explorer API: `https://testnet.blockscout-api.injective.network/api`

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the Injective Chain ID is natively `injective-888`. However, EVM uses a numeric chain ID of `1439`. While these are different, they map to the **same** network.

### Tokens

* wINJ (wrapped INJ) - [`0x0000000088827d2d103ee2d9A6b781773AE03FfB`](https://testnet.blockscout.injective.network/address/0x0000000088827d2d103ee2d9A6b781773AE03FfB)
* USDT (MTS USDT) - [`0xaDC7bcB5d8fe053Ef19b4E0C861c262Af6e0db60`](https://testnet.blockscout.injective.network/address/0xaDC7bcB5d8fe053Ef19b4E0C861c262Af6e0db60)
  * Note that this follows the [MultiVM Token Standard](https://docs.injective.network/developers-evm/multivm-token-standard), which means the same token can be used in all Injective modules (EVM, Cosmos) without using a bridge.
