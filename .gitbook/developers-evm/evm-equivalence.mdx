## Injective EVM vs. Ethereum Mainnet

Injective's native EVM us a fully embedded execution environment that has been integrated into the core architecture of the chain. It is designed to be a 1:1 equivalent to Ethereum in terms of development experience.

Native EVM on Injective supports the latest version of `geth`, ensuring that developers have access to the latest features, tooling, security patches, and improvements. In addition, Injective’s EVM enhances performance and expands capabilities, granting access to Injective's sophisticated financial infrastructure that extends beyond what’s available on Ethereum.
