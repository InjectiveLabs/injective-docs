## Injective's Permissions Module

The [`permissions` module](https://docs.injective.network/developers-native/injective/permissions)
is native to Injective, and allows custom management (e.g. roles) for Denoms.
This capability is extended to MultiVM Token Standard (MTS) tokens,
where you can implement those custom management rules within your EVM smart contract code.

## Why Uses Permissions on MTS Tokens?

If you are tokenizing real world assets (RWAs) using MTS on Injective,
and that underlying asset inherently requires permissions,
that is a great use case for tapping into Injective's `permissions` module.

The EVM smart contract of your MTS token simply needs to implement
an additional Solidity interface to leverage the power of the `permissions` module.

## Implementation

In your smart contract, import `IPermissionsHook` from `PermissionsHook.sol` and extend it.

```solidity
interface IPermissionsHook
```

This will involve implementing the `isTransferRestricted` function,
with the following signature:

```solidity
function isTransferRestricted(
  address from,
  address to,
  Cosmos.Coin calldata amount
)
```

You may find the full file on Github:
[`PermissionsHook.sol`](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/solidity-contracts/blob/master/src/PermissionsHook.sol)

## Example

Create a smart contract that extends `PermissionsHook`:

```solidity
import { Cosmos } from "../src/CosmosTypes.sol";
import { PermissionsHook } from "../src/PermissionsHook.sol";
contract RestrictedAddressTransferHook is PermissionsHook {
  /*
  ...
  */
}
```

Add a custom implementation of the `isTransferRestricted` function.
For example, this function will allow all transfers,
exepct for ones involving a specific address:

```solidity
  function isTransferRestricted(
    address from,
    address to,
    Cosmos.Coin calldata amount
  ) external pure override returns (bool) {
    address restrictedAddress = '0x...';
    if (from == restrictedAddress || to == restrictedAddress) {
      // this particular address is not allowed to transfer
      return true;
    }

    // All other transfers are allowed
    return false;
  }
```
