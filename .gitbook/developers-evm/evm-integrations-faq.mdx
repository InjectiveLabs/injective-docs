## Does Injective EVM Support ...?

**Does Injective EVM Support (EVM feature)?**

A: Generally, the answer is "yes".
See below for more specific questions.

**Does Injective EVM Support these specific opcodes?**

A: Yes. We have parity with opcode implementation.
More precisely: We have not added any custom opcodes,
neither have we modified the behaviour of any opcodes.

**Does Injective EVM Support ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155?**

A: Yes, any Solidity based smart contract standards should work,
as these *do not* require any special features beyond the standard EVM.

Corollary: When implementing fungible tokens,
ERC20 and any others that are extensions of it,
we strongly recommend that you implement them as a MultiVM Token Standard (MTS) token.
This allows the same token to act as a fungible token not only on Injective's EVM,
but also on Injective native (specifically as Cosmos Denoms).
Should Injective add other VMs in the future, MTS tokens will also work on those.
Read more about MTS:
[General article](https://injective.com/blog/multivm-token-standard-wrapped-inj), and
[technical reference](/developers-evm/multivm-token-standard).

**Does Injective EVM Support EIP-1559?**

A: Yes.

## Can I use ... on Injective EVM?

A: Generally, the answer is "yes".
See below for more specific questions.

**Can I use (EVM tool/ library) on Injective EVM?**

A:

- viem - yes
- ethers.js - yes
- hardhat - yes
- foundry - yes

**Can I use Foundry on Injective EVM with Injective's EVM precompiles?**

A: Injective's [EVM precompiles](/developers-evm/precompiles)
access Injective native functions that are not available in generic EVMs.
This means that if you use, for example Foundry and connect it to:

- Injective EVM Testnet, it will work
- `localhost` simulated EVM network, it will not work

To address the latter issue, we've forked the Foundry tools to support
Injective precompiles (starting with Bank precompile needed for `BankERC20.sol` and MTS),
if you are using Solidity tests or deployment scripts as a Foundry project,
you will need this so `forge`/ `cast` can do local simulations.

Latest releases, with pre-built binaries for x86_64 Linux and macOS ARM64,
can be found at [github.com/InjectiveLabs/foundry/releases](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/foundry/releases).

## Which EVM development infrastructure is available on Injective?

Refer to the [EVM Integrations Cheat Sheet](/developers-evm/evm-integrations-cheat-sheet)
for the answers.

## How can I resolve JSON-RPC dropped responses?

A: If you are using the public endpoint for RPCs,
this is likely to happen to you due to rate limiting.
These endpoints are designed for very light usage.
If you have deployed a complex application,
you should consider using a commercial grade RPC endpoint instead.

You may find recommended RPC providers in the
[EVM Integrations Cheat Sheet](/developers-evm/evm-integrations-cheat-sheet).

## Are `inj...` addresses and `0x...` addresses comaptible?

A: Yes. In fact they are the same, simply rendered in different formats.

Refer to [Convert addresses](https://docs.injective.network/developers/convert-addresses)
for example code to convert between these two formats.

## Which EVM hardfork does Injective support?

A: Here's the live configuration data for the EVM:
[sentry.lcd.injective.network/injective/evm/v1/params](https://sentry.lcd.injective.network/injective/evm/v1/params)

Under `chain_config`, there are keys that correspond to EVM hard fork names (with suffixes).
These indicate which ones are enabled.
The value for these keys are the block numbers at which they are enabled.
As of the Mainnet launch, all of them are set to `0`,
i.e. they are enabled from the "genesis" EVM block.
For future EVM hardforks, new keys will be added that will have a non-zero block number
at which they will be (or were) enabled.
