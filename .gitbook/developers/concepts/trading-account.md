# Trading Account

Subaccounts or Trading Accounts are a concept that allows you to decouple the funds in the native Injective Bank module (which can be used for staking, bidding on auctions, participating in governance, creating markets, etc) into an isolated trading account from which you can execute trades. One Injective address can have an unlimited number of trading accounts. The way they are represented is `${ethereumAddress}${subaccountNonce}` where the `ethereumAddress` is the `hex` version of the `bech32` Injective address and the `subaccountNonce` is the nonce represented in 12 bytes. An example trading account at nonce 1 would be `0xc7dca7c15c364865f77a4fb67ab11dc95502e6fe000000000000000000000001`.

Starting the v1.10.0 chain upgrade, the Bank balance and the default trading account (at nonce = 0) will be merged and the Bank funds will be directly used when executing trades originating from the default trading account.
