title: MCP Server
description: Connect AI assistants to Injective documentation using the Model Context Protocol
---

The Injective documentation provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants like
Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools to **search and retrieve information** from the Injective docs.

This is powerful not only for documentation search, but also useful when **used in combination** with other MCP servers and with AI agents.
For example, you could add vibe code Injective applications by connecting your agentic development tools, such as Cursor,
using this MCP server to **add Injective-specific knowledge** to the LLM's general-purpose software writing abilities.
Details on how to configure your developer tools are included below.

## What is MCP?

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an **open standard** that enables AI assistants to connect to external data sources and tools.
Instead of relying solely on training data, AI assistants can use MCP to access real-time, authoritative information directly from documentation.

## Why use the Injective MCP server?

When you connect an AI assistant to the Injective MCP server, it can:

- Search the complete Injective documentation
- Find code examples, API references, and guides
- Answer questions with up-to-date information
- Provide direct links to relevant documentation pages

This is particularly useful when building on Injective, as the AI can help you find the right documentation for your specific use case.

## MCP server details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Endpoint | `https://docs.injective.network/mcp` |
| Transport | HTTP (Streamable HTTP) |
| Available tool | `SearchInjectiveDocs` |

## Connecting to the MCP server

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="All MCP clients">
    For MCP-compatible clients, use the endpoint URL directly:

    ```
    https://docs.injective.network/mcp
    ```

    The server uses Streamable HTTP transport, which is supported by most modern MCP clients.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    Add the MCP server in Cursor's settings:

    1. Open Cursor Settings
    2. Navigate to **Features** → **MCP Servers**
    3. Click **Add new MCP server**
    4. Enter the following:
       - **Name**: `injective-docs`
       - **Type**: `command`
       - **Command**: `npx mcp-remote https://docs.injective.network/mcp`
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Claude Desktop">
    Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS">
        Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "injective-docs": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": [
                "mcp-remote",
                "https://docs.injective.network/mcp"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "injective-docs": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": [
                "mcp-remote",
                "https://docs.injective.network/mcp"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    After saving the configuration, restart Claude Desktop. The Injective Docs tool will appear in Claude's available tools.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using the MCP server

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant questions about Injective.
The assistant will automatically use the `SearchInjectiveDocs` tool to find relevant information.

**Example prompts:**

- "How do I create a wallet on Injective?"
- "Show me how to deploy a CosmWasm smart contract"
- "What are the network endpoints for Injective mainnet?"
- "How do I use the Token Factory module?"
- "Explain how margin trading works on Injective"

The AI will search the documentation and provide answers with links to the relevant pages.

## MCP Tool reference

### `SearchInjectiveDocs`

Searches across the Injective documentation to find relevant information.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | string | Yes | The search query to find relevant documentation |

**Returns:**

Contextual content with titles and direct links to documentation pages.
The tool performs a semantic search across the entire Injective documentation corpus, matching your query against page content, headings, and code examples.
Results are ranked by relevance and returned with extracted snippets that best answer your query, along with source URLs for further reading.

**Example:**

Request:
```json
{
  "tool": "SearchInjectiveDocs",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "how to create a token using token factory"
  }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "# Token Factory\n\nThe Token Factory module allows you to create and manage custom tokens on Injective...\n\n## Creating a Token\n\nTo create a new token, use the `tokenfactory/create-denom` message...\n\nSource: https://docs.injective.network/developers/concepts/token-factory"
    }
  ]
}
```
