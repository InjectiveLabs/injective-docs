# About Injective

Injective is a lightning-fast, interoperable, layer-one blockchain optimized for building premier Web3 financial applications. Injective provides developers with robust plug-and-play modules such as a fully decentralized orderbook, binary options, real-world asset (RWA) module, and more, allowing developers to build a diverse array of sophisticated applications.

### What is Injective?[​](https://docs.injective.network/learn/introduction#what-is-injective) <a href="#what-is-injective" id="what-is-injective"></a>

Injective is the blockchain built for finance.

Injective is the only blockchain where developers can find robust out-of-the-box modules, such as a completely decentralized orderbook that can be utilized to build a diverse array of sophisticated applications. Moreover, Injective is an open, interoperable smart contracts platform.

Injective is built with the Cosmos SDK, enabling instant transaction finality through the Tendermint proof-of-stake consensus framework. Moreover, Injective excels in enabling swift cross-chain transactions, seamlessly bridging prominent layer-one networks like Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos Hub, and more.

The Injective ecosystem is a network of decentralized applications that focus on providing the best in-class user experience. By providing the unrestricted and unprecedented ability to access decentralized financial markets, products, services, and toolings, the Injective ecosystem empowers individuals with the ability to allocate capital more efficiently.

### Why Build on Injective?[​](https://docs.injective.network/learn/introduction#why-build-on-injective) <a href="#why-build-on-injective" id="why-build-on-injective"></a>

* Optimized for decentralized finance: Injective provides out-of-the-box financial primitives such as a fully decentralized orderbook to allow developers to create mainstream dApps. For instance, applications can leverage the orderbook to launch exchanges, prediction markets, and various other on-chain strategies.
* Interoperable: Injective is natively interoperable across many sovereign blockchain networks while also being IBC-enabled. Injective can facilitate seamless cross-chain transactions across Ethereum, Moonbeam, IBC-enabled chains such as CosmosHub, and Wormhole integrated chains such as Solana, Avalanche, etc.
* Build dApps Using CosmWasm: Injective supports CosmWasm, a novel smart contracting platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem. This means developers can easily launch their own smart-contract powered applications on Injective. Smart-contracts that work on other chains supporting CosmWasm can seamlessly be migrated to Injective.
* Launch Ethereum and IBC compatible tokens: Since Injective supports cross-chain transactions with Ethereum and all IBC-enabled chains, tokens launched on Injective can be exposed to multiple networks by default.
* Intuitive developer experience: Utilize flexible and expressive development environments powered by Rust and Golang.
