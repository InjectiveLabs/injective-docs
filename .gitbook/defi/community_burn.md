# Community Burn

### What is the Community Burn?

The Community Burn is a monthly onchain event that allows anyone to take part in Injective’s deflationary mechanism. Participants commit INJ, and in return receive a pro rata share of the revenue generated across the Injective ecosystem. The INJ exchanged is then permanently burned, reducing the total supply.

This process rewards the community, increases scarcity of INJ, and aligns long-term value with ecosystem success. The Community Burn evolved from the original Burn Auction, replacing the winner-take-all model with a simpler, more accessible, and community-driven design.

### Key Details at a Glance

A quick reference box (almost like a cheat sheet) with the most important parameters:

* Cadence: 28 days
* Slots: Fixed number
* Funding Source: Portion of ecosystem-generated revenue
* Commitment: INJ only, within posted min/max limits
* Distribution: Pro rata, based on INJ commitment
* Outcome: INJ burned + assets distributed to participants
* Transparency: Fully onchain

### Why It Matters

* Deflationary Design – Each round burns INJ, reducing total supply
* Democratized Access – Shared opportunity vs. one auction winner
* Aligned Incentives – Rewards scale with ecosystem activity, rather than network congestion (txn fees stay low regardless)
* Onchain Proof – Everything is transparent and verifiable

### How It Works

1. **Secure Your Spot**\
   Once per month, a fixed number of reservation slots open. Anyone can reserve a slot while they remain available.
2. **Commit INJ**\
   Reserve your slot by committing INJ within the displayed minimum and maximum limits. Commitments are made onchain during the event window and cannot be altered once submitted.
3. **Claim Earnings**\
   When the event concludes, all INJ commitments are exchanged for the revenue collected that month. This revenue, made up of multiple different tokens, is distributed pro rata to all participants.\
   \
   To claim, simply go to Injective Hub → Community Burn, and press Claim next to the round you participated in under Burn Auction History.
4. **INJ Burn**\
   The total INJ collected from all participants is permanently burned, reducing the total supply of INJ.
5. **Get Ready for Next Month**\
   Track your earnings, monitor stats from previous rounds, and stay updated on the next Community Burn directly from your Injective Hub dashboard. All slot reservations, commitments, burn transactions, and distributions are publicly visible onchain.

### FAQ

**What determines my share?**\
Your share equals your committed INJ divided by the total INJ committed across all participants (pro rata).

**Can I withdraw or change my commitment once made?**\
No, commitments are final once submitted.

**How do I know the burn happened?**\
The burn transaction is onchain and can be tracked via the [Injective Hub](https://injhub.com/community-burn)

**What if I miss a round?**\
You’ll need to wait until next month’s event opens.

### Exchange Module

The exchange module is one of Injective’s central differentiators from other blockchains. This technical instrument is what powers the shared liquidity environment on Injective and fuels the Burn Auction. The entire process of orderbook management, trade execution, order matching, and settlement occurs on-chain through the logic codified by the module.

The design feature that is key to the Burn Auction is the built-in revenue-sharing structure for applications employing the exchange module. Herein, a portion of the accrued revenue is allocated to the auction module for inclusion in the current Burn Auction event, while the remaining portion is retained by the application utilizing the module to power its exchange services.

### Auction Module

The auction module provides two essential services for the operation of the Community Burn: token collection and auction orchestration. For token collection, the module periodically gathers tokens from the exchange module, pooling them into an Community Burn Fund. Importantly, the Community Burn Fund also receives tokens from applications that do not utilize the exchange module but have opted into participation, as well as from individual user contributions.
