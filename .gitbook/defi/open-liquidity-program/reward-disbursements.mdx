description: How OLP Rewards Are Disbursed
title: Reward Disbursements
---

OLP Rewards are sent directly to the participants' addresses after the end of each epoch. **Half of the earned INJ rewards are paid out immediately, while the other half is subject to a 3 epoch vesting period**. If the address is inactive (earns rewards < 1 INJ) for any epoch during the vesting period, the vested rewards will be subject to forfeiture. All rewards are subject to governance approval, and all addresses eligible for more than 500 INJ per epoch are subject to KYC/KYB verification before their reward disbursement is included in a governance proposal submitted by Injective Labs. While any address can permissionlessly join OLP, reward eligibility is dependent on KYC/KYB.

Disbursements usually occur a few days after the conclusion of each epoch due to the governance process required.

Reward disbursements can be tracked on the Community Spend Pool page on the [Injective Explorer](https://explorer.injective.network/).
