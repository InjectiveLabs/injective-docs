# Epochs

An epoch is the period of time in which market makers are evaluated based on their relative performance. Several metrics are cumulatively tracked during each epoch, which reset upon the commencement of a new epoch. Rewards are disbursed after the completion each epoch (see [Rewards Disbursement](reward-disbursements.md)). Currently, **each epoch is 28 days long**.

The **first public OLP epoch (epoch 21) began on June 13, 2023 at 0:00 UTC**.

Start and end dates for OLP epochs can be found in the following table, which is updated occasionally (typically a few months in advance) to include future epochs :
