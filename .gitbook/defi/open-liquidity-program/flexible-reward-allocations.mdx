title: "Flexible Reward Allocations"

Part of the changes implemented for epoch 43 include a fully discretionary dynamic reward to bootstrap liquidity for certain markets at specific times. Following the exact same calculations detailed in [reward-allocations](./reward-allocations/), and the classic formula/scoring methodology to determine a liquidity provider's share of the total reward for a market, this will be accomplished through the concept of Mini Epochs, which incur a "boosted reward" that comes out of the total reward for the main "parent" epoch.

Mini Epochs are flexible in that they are not constrained by the starting/ending point for a pair to exist in a Primary Epoch. Mini Epochs can begin or end on any date (at 00:00 UTC) within a Primary Epoch, though they cannot span multiple epochs.

Rewards for Mini Epochs will be clearly defined. All eligible OLP participants can accrue pair-specific rewards for Mini Epochs, even if they are not otherwise earning rewards for that pair. Of course, a liquidity provider's participation in the Mini Epoch implies participation in the Primary Epoch, even if just opportunistically for that specific time period. Rewards for Mini Epochs are visible on the OLP dashboard side-by-side with the overall rewards for the Primary Epoch.

For example, if there is a 500 INJ Mini Epoch for a pair, providing liquidity for that pair during the Mini Epoch entitles you to the normal allocation for that pair plus a pro-rata allocation of the 500 INJ Mini Epoch, which comes out of the parent epoch's rewards. In this example, if a parent epoch has a reward of 30,000 INJ, this means that 29,500 INJ will be distributed based on scores for the parent epoch, and 500 INJ will be distrubuted based on scores for the Mini Epoch.
