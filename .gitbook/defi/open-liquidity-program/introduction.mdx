Injective uniquely provides the world's first truly onchain orderbook environment to bring shared liquidity across all DeFi applications. By relentlessly pursuing deeper liquidity, Injective empowers users and protocols with seamless access to capital-efficient markets not available elsewhere.

Driven by an unwavering commitment to innovation, Injective has created the [**Open Liquidity Program (OLP)**](https://trading.injective.network/program/liquidity) which caters to institutions and everyday traders alike. This milestone signifies a new era in which market makers and participants can earn rewards for providing orderbook liquidity with minimal barriers to entry. This guide offers a comprehensive walkthrough of the Open Liquidity Program and provides details on how you can become an OLP member.

Rewards for OLP are disbursed in the form of INJ, Injective's native utility and governance token. Currently, **30,000 INJ** can be earned by eligible participants during each epoch (28 day period).

This amount may be reassessed in advance for future epochs, or retroactively reduced for a current epoch as a result of one or more volatility response modifications (VRMs). For more information on OLP epochs, see [Epochs](./epochs).

A list of trading pairs eligible for rewards can be found on the [OLP Dashboard](https://trading.injective.network/program/liquidity).

<Info>
  All rewards are subject to governance approval by the Injective community.
