# Reward Disbursements

OLP Rewards are sent directly to the participants' addresses after the end of each epoch, pending a governance proposal that must be voted on by the community over a four-day period. **Half of the earned INJ rewards are paid out in this immediate proposal, while the other half is subject to a three epoch vesting period**. If an eligible address becomes inactive (which is defined by either not meeting the daily volume criteria at the start of the epoch, _or_ earning a reward for a given epoch of less than 60% of the prior epoch's reward) for any epoch during the vesting period, the vested rewards will be subject to forfeiture.

All rewards are subject to governance approval, and all addresses eligible for more than 500 INJ per epoch are subject to KYC/KYB verification before their reward disbursement is included in a governance proposal submitted by Injective Labs. While any address can permissionlessly join OLP, reward eligibility is dependent on KYC/KYB.

Disbursements usually occur a few days after the conclusion of each epoch due to the governance process required.

Reward disbursements can be tracked on the Community Spend Pool page on the [Injective Explorer](https://explorer.injective.network/).
