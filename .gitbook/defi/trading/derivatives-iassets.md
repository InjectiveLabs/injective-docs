# iAssets

iAssets are a new class of real-world asset (RWA) derivatives that bring traditional markets - such as equities, commodities, and FX - onto Injective in a fully on-chain, composable, and capital-efficient form.

Unlike basic tokenized representations of RWAs, iAssets are programmable financial primitives with second-order utility. This means they aren’t just static mirrors of off-chain assets, they’re designed to enable:

* Dynamic liquidity allocation
* Position-based exposure
* Cross-market composability (e.g. combining iAssets with other on-chain derivatives and DeFi strategies)

iAssets do not require pre-funding or wrapping of the underlying asset. Instead, they exist purely as synthetic derivatives, powered by Injective’s on-chain perpetual futures engine and decentralized oracle infrastructure. More information on iAssets can be found in [the whitepaper](https://injective.com/iAssets_Paper.pdf).

iAssets trade identically to other Injective perpetual futures contracts:

* Margin is posted in USDT (or other supported stablecoins)
* Leverage is available (varies by market, but is typically 25x for equities, 50x for commodities, and 100x for FX)
* Positions are USDT-settled, not physically delivered
* Liquidations follow Injective’s auction-based mechanism

The key difference between iAssets and crypto perps lies in mark price behavior. A general overview of the differences can be found in the chart below, though there are exceptions for maintenance windows, and trading holidays.

| Asset Class              | Price Feed Hours                       | Trading Hours |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Crypto                   | 24/7                                   | 24/7          |
| iAssets (Equities)       | Every weekday from 9.30AM ET to 4PM ET | 24/7          |
| iAssets (FX/commodities) | From Sunday 6PM ET to Friday 5PM ET    | 24/7          |

* iAssets continue trading 24/7 on Injective, even when the mark price is not updating. Users are always warned of the potential risks when trading iAssets through a frontend like Helix, which checks for oracle liveness.
* Outside market hours, price feeds are held constant. Because the mark price does not update, it's virtually impossible to get liquidated outside of these times.
* This allows users to take or unwind positions around the clock, but PNL will not shift until the next price update cycle resumes.

Mark prices for iAssets are sourced via decentralized oracles such as Pyth, which aggregate high-fidelity, low-latency price data from primary market sources. For more information on the price feeds used for iAssets, please visit [Pyth](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/market-hours).
