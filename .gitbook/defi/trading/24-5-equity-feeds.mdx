description: "How 24/5 pricing for onchain equities works on Injective."
---

Injective now supports 24/5 pricing for selected US equities by aggregating multiple Pyth session feeds into a single, unified oracle stream. This enables smooth, continuous trading for equity perpetuals, even when the underlying stock moves across pre-market, regular hours, after-hours, and overnight sessions.

### Overview

US equities trade across four distinct sessions. Pyth publishes a separate price feed for each:

- Pre-market
- Regular trading hours
- After-hours
- Overnight / off-exchange liquidity

Injective uses SEDA to combine these four session feeds into a single oracle price per symbol, updating approximately every 2 seconds. This unified stream becomes the canonical index price for Injective equity perpetuals.

Currently supported onchain equities:

- NVDA
- PLTR

More equities will migrate to this model in the coming weeks, and this list will be updated as onchain governance formalizes the upgrades.

### How the Aggregation Works

For each supported stock, SEDA:

1. Subscribes to the four relevant Pyth feeds
2. Selects the correct session feed based on live market phase
3. Applies lightweight sanity and continuity checks
4. Outputs one continuous price to Injective

This ensures:

- No session-to-session gaps
- Continuous charts and oracle flow
- Consistent mark/index pricing for 24/5 trading
- Minimal noise during session transitions

The aggregation cadence is approximately 2 seconds, giving traders near real-time responsiveness across all sessions.

### Benefits for Traders & Market Makers

1. **True 24/5 Equity Trading**: Equity perpetuals on Injective can track price action across all four US equity sessions without interruption.
2. **Cleaner Pricing**: No juggling multiple feeds, no abrupt jumps caused by switching sessions, as SEDA standardizes everything into one continuous stream.
3. **Better Risk Modeling**: Margin, liquidations, and mark-price logic use one consistent oracle, improving predictability and reducing false risk triggers.
4. **Professional-grade extended hours coverage**: Thin-liquidity periods like pre-market or after-hours are still reflected accurately via Pyth’s specialized feeds.

### Trading Behavior & Considerations

- Volatility varies dramatically by session. Pre-market and after-hours can be more illiquid, so expect wider spreads despite continuous pricing.
- Gaps still occur when news hits between sessions. The unified feed simply ensures the chart reflects the actual first traded price, not a “feed boundary” artifact.
- 24/5, not 24/7. The oracle pauses only on weekends, aligned with the underlying equity market structure.
