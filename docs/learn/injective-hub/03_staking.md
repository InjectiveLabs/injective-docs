# Staking

Staking is the process of locking up your assets (in this case INJ) in order to validate transactions on the blockchain. Users who choose to stake will be able to obtain rewards as a result of that process. 

Injective follows a proof-of-stake mechanism, in which users can stake their tokens to certain Injective validators who will do the work of validating transactions, while the user reaps the benefit through only contributing assets.

## Stake INJ

Stake your INJ to a validator to start earning rewards.

## Withdraw staking rewards

Rewards start accruing the moment you stake INJ. Monitor your rewards in the staking section of Injective Hub. Once you have earned a sufficient amount of rewards, you may withdraw them at any time.

## Redelegate

Redelegating lets you transfer staked INJ from one validator to another without waiting the 21-day unstaking period. Redelegating happens instantly.

## Undelegate

Undelegating INJ is the process of unstaking your assets from a validator. The unstaking period takes 21 days to complete.
