# Wallet

Injective Wallet allows you to monitor your assets on Injective. Assets can be native tokens on Injective, as well as bridged assets from Ethereum, Moonbeam and various IBC-enabled chains.

You can also send assets to other Injective wallets using the wallet. Note that Injective supports the `memo` field, so please be reminded to check whether your recipient requires this detail to be filled before transferring assets.
