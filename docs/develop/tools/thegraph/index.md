# Substreams from The Graph

Injective has integrated Substreams from The Graph to allow developers to extract data from the Injective blockchain. This data can then be consumed in several ways, such as a subgraph, via gRPC streaming, using a SQL database, and many more. To get started, see [here](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/intro-injective).
