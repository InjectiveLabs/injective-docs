# Overview

It is highly recommended that you set up a local private network before joining a public network. This will help get familiar with the setup process, and provide an environment for testing. 

**Private Network**

- Join by setting up a standalone network locally

**Public Network**
- Join via public endpoints; or
- Join by running a node

Anyone can setup their node with endpoints to communicate with the Injective blockchain, for convenience there are also some public endpoints available for querying the chain. These are recommended for development and testing purposes. For maximun control and reliability it's recommended to run your own node. 

## Preperation For Running a Node

If you choose to run a node (either to set up the private network or join the public network), you have to set up the keyring. Also, you can also choose to intall Cosmovisor.

## Interacting With The Node

Once the node is up and running, there are a few ways to interact with a node, namely using the CLI (`injectived`), gPRC and REST endpoints
